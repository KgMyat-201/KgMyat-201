- 👋 Hi, I’m Kaung Myat Hein. <!-- @KgMyat-201 --/>

- 👀 I am a hobbyist Web Developer with a working profiency in HTML, CSS and JQuery.
      I have a solid understanding of Bootstrap, SASS and Github version control.
      
- 🌱 I am currently expanding my skill set by studying Javascript, PHP along with MySQL and Laravel Framework.

- 💞️ My goal is to take the step from hobbyist to professional with a company where i can learn, grow and showcase my skills.
      On a forever journey of professional growth as well as learning from and sharing with other creatives.
      
- 📫 I believe that with my current experience I would be an excellent choice for an entry level Junior Developer.
